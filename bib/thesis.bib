  abstract  = {Priority queues are fundamental to many multiprocessor applications. Several priority queue algorithms based on skiplists have been proposed, as skiplists allow concurrent accesses to different parts of the data structure in a simple way. However, for priority queues on multiprocessors, an inherent bottleneck is the operation that deletes the minimal element. We present a linearizable, lock-free, concurrent priority queue algorithm, based on skiplists, which minimizes the contention for shared memory that is caused by the DeleteMin operation. The main idea is to minimize the number of global updates to shared memory that are performed in one DeleteMin. In comparison with other skiplist-based priority queue algorithms, our algorithm achieves a 30 - 80{\%} improvement.},

  abstract   = { High-performance concurrent priority queues are essential for applications such as task scheduling and discrete event simulation. Unfortunately, even the best performing implementations do not scale past a number of threads in the single digits. This is because of the sequential bottleneck in accessing the elements at the head of the queue in order to perform a DeleteMin operation. In this paper, we present the SprayList, a scalable priority queue with relaxed ordering semantics. Starting from a non-blocking SkipList, the main innovation behind our design is that the DeleteMin operations avoid a sequential bottleneck by ``spraying'' themselves onto the head of the SkipList list in a coordinated fashion. The spraying is implemented using a carefully designed random walk, so that DeleteMin returns an element among the first O(p log^3 p) in the list, with high probability, where p is the number of threads. We prove that the running time of a DeleteMin operation is O(log^3 p), with high probability, independent of the size of the list. Our experiments show that the relaxed semantics allow the data structure to scale for high thread counts, comparable to a classic unordered SkipList. Furthermore, we observe that, for reasonably parallel workloads, the scalability benefits of relaxation considerably outweigh the additional work due to out-of-order execution. },

With the rapid deployment of parallel platforms, concurrent versions of priority queues are becoming increasingly important. In this paper, we present a novel concurrent lock-free linearizable algorithm for priority queues that scales significantly better than all known lock-based or lock-free priority queues. Our design employs several techniques to obtain its advantages including lock-free chunks, the use of the efficient fetch-and-increment atomic instruction, and elimination. Measurements under high contention demonstrate performance improvement by up\"{\i} undefinedto a factor of 1.8 over existing approaches.},

  abstract  = {We present a first lock-free design and implementation of a dynamically resizable array (vector). The most extensively used container in the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) is vector, offering a combination of dynamic memory management and constant-time random access. Our approach is based on a single 32-bit word atomic compare-and-swap (CAS) instruction. It provides a linearizable and highly parallelizable STL-like interface, lock-free memory allocation and management, and fast execution. Our current implementation is designed to be most efficient on multi-core architectures. Experiments on a dual-core Intel processor with shared L2 cache indicate that our lock-free vector outperforms its lock-based STL counterpart and the latest concurrent vector implementation provided by Intel by a large factor. The performance evaluation on a quad dual-core AMD system with non-shared L2 cache demonstrated timing results comparable to the best available lock-based techniques. The presented design implements the most common STL vector's interfaces, namely random access read and write, tail insertion and deletion, pre-allocation of memory, and query of the container's size. Using the current implementation, a user has to avoid one particular ABA problem.},

  abstract   = {Data series similarity search is a core operation for several data series analysis applications across many different domains. However, the state-of-the-art techniques fail to deliver the time performance required for interactive exploration, or analysis of large data series collections. In this work, we propose MESSI, the first data series index designed for in-memory operation on modern hardware. Our index takes advantage of the modern hardware parallelization opportunities (i.e., SIMD instructions, multi-socket and multi-core architectures), in order to accelerate both index construction and similarity search processing times. Moreover, it benefits from a careful design in the setup and coordination of the parallel workers and data structures, so that it maximizes its performance for in-memory operations. MESSI supports similarity search using both the Euclidean and dynamic time warping (DTW) distances. Our experiments with synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that overall MESSI is up to 4x faster at index construction and up to 11x faster at query answering than the state-of-the-art parallel approach. MESSI is the first to answer exact similarity search queries on 100GB datasets in ~50 ms (30–75 ms across diverse datasets), which enables real-time, interactive data exploration on very large data series collections.},

  abstract   = {We present a new, concurrent, lock-free priority queue that relaxes the delete-min operation to allow deletion of any of the ? smallest keys instead of only a minimal one, where ? is a parameter that can be configured at runtime. It is built from a logarithmic number of sorted arrays, similar to log-structured merge-trees (LSM). For keys added and removed by the same thread the behavior is identical to a non-relaxed priority queue. We compare to state-of-the-art lock-free priority queues with both relaxed and non-relaxed semantics, showing high performance and good scalability of our approach.},

  abstract  = {Priority queues are fundamental abstract data types, often used to manage limited resources in parallel systems. Typical proposed parallel priority queue implementations are based on heaps or skip lists. In recent literature, skip lists have been shown to be the most efficient design choice for implementing priority queues. Though numerous intricate implementations of skip list based queues have been proposed in the literature, their performance is constrained by the high number of global atomic updates per operation and the high memory consumption, which are proportional to the number of sub-lists in the queue.},
